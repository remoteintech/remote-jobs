We respect the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and this policy document explains how we collect and handle any information you provide to us.

## Analytics

This website uses [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/), a privacy-focused analytics tool. Fathom is designed to be GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy, and PECR compliant.

**What Fathom collects:**
- Page views (which pages are visited)
- Referrer information (where visitors come from)
- Browser and device type (aggregated, not individual)
- Country-level location (not precise location)

**What Fathom does NOT collect:**
- No cookies are used
- No personal data is collected
- No cross-site tracking
- IP addresses are not stored

Fathom generates anonymous, aggregate statistics only. Individual visitors cannot be identified. You can read more about [Fathom's privacy compliance](https://usefathom.com/compliance).

## Data Collection

Beyond the anonymous analytics described above, this website does not collect any personal data. There are no sign-up forms, no accounts, and no cookies.

## Website Security

This website transmits itself using HTTPS, encrypting all data between the browser and the server. Your network provider can still see that you are downloading assets from this site, but not its content. This also protects you from third parties intercepting data, for example, while browsing on public WiFi, or from network providers injecting advertisements on this site.

## Third-Party Links

This site contains links to company career pages and external resources. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites. We encourage you to review their privacy policies.

## Contact

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please [contact us](/contact/).

## Changes to This Policy

If we change the content of this policy, those changes will be effective at the time we post them here.

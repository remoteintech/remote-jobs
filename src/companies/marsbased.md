## Company blurb


MarsBased is a development consultancy from Barcelona offering end‑to‑end web & mobile apps based on Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and Python. We work for Fortune 500 and high-growth companies from all over the world with our distributed team of senior software engineers and designers.

## Company size

At present, 30 people (16/02/2026).

## Remote status

We're a 100% remote-first company. We do not have physical offices, and our employees are scattered around Spain and Portugal.

We tend to minimise meetings and videocalls to a minimum but we depend on each client because we're a services company. In the company, though, we don't do dailies.

Every three months, we host the Martian Day, during which we all team up in Barcelona for a couple of days of get-together, hands-on meetings with the founders, workshops, keynotes and some time off. Once per year, we go on a company retreat for a few days of work and leisure. We also do online activities to bond, which you can read about on our [company handbook](https://github.com/MarsBased/handbook).

## Region

We're just hiring EU-residents with a working permit. Freelancers willing to do contract work might apply from anywhere, but won't be eligible for a full-time job inside the company.

## Company technologies

Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Node.js, Angular, React, Vue.js, React Native, Python, Django, FastAPI, Flask, CSS.

## Office locations

No physical offices, but we're from Barcelona.

We partner with ambitious enterprises to create scalable software solutions that enhance digital experiences, empower developers, and deliver measurable results.

We believe in the importance of a healthy life/work balance. Our flexible, remote-first culture allows Nearformers to work around what matters to them, whether that’s friends, family, hobbies or training, and prioritise their wellbeing.

Every team member receives a bi-annual remote working support budget to create a comfortable workspace that suits their individual needs. We also give employees the chance to take their work on the road with them, as Nearformers can spend up to three months working from anywhere in the world.

Nearformers foster a special kind of culture and sense of community - through Slack, online sessions, our various tech communities and virtual social groups, everyone has endless possibilities to collaborate, learn from and connect with colleagues across the world.

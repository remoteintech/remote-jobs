## Company blurb

#### About

Mux was founded in 2015 by Jon Dahl, Steve Heffernan, Matt McClure, and Adam Brown, four engineers and veterans of online video who are passionate about video technology and performance. The team now includes engineers from YouTube, Twitch, Brightcove, and Facebook.

At Zencoder, they helped move video encoding to the cloud, replacing stacks of encoding servers with a clean, powerful API for groups like Amazon, PBS, and the NFL. Zencoder was co-founded in 2010 by Jon, Steve, and a third founder, and was acquired two years later by Brightcove.

While at Zencoder, they also helped pioneer the move from Flash to HTML5 video by creating Video.js, which is now the most widely deployed open-source video player on the web. Today, Video.js is used by Instagram, Twitter, Microsoft, and hundreds of thousands of other websites.

The team behind Mux is also responsible for Demuxed, the premiere conference for engineers working on video. They blog, podcast, and have spoken about video and data technology around the world.

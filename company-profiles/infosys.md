## Company size

323,578

## Remote status

Infosys, one of India's leading IT services companies, has introduced a new policy requiring employees to work from the office for at least 10 days per month, effective from March 2025. This move aligns with the company’s efforts to enhance collaboration while maintaining a hybrid work model.

Managerial Approval Now Required for Additional WFH Days

Under the updated policy, employees cannot automatically work from home beyond the designated days without managerial approval. The company has introduced system interventions to track and regulate remote work requests, ensuring they align with business needs and project priorities.

### Who Is Affected?

The policy primarily applies to employees at Job Level 5 (JL5) and below, which includes roles such as:

Software Engineers
Senior Engineers
System Engineers
Consultants

Additionally, managers and senior managers at Job Level 6 (JL6) and above are also required to comply. However, senior leadership, such as vice presidents and above, are reportedly exempt from this policy.

### Enforcement and Compliance Measures

Infosys has implemented digital attendance tracking through its mobile app to monitor employee check-ins at office locations. Employees who do not meet the required in-office attendance may face deductions from their leave balance as a measure to ensure compliance.

### Industry-Wide Trend Toward Office Returns

Infosys’s move reflects a broader shift in the IT sector, where companies are encouraging employees to return to offices. Competitors like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) have already enforced similar return-to-office mandates, linking compliance to variable pay structures.

### Balancing Flexibility and Collaboration

The decision to enforce a structured hybrid work model aims to strike a balance between flexibility and in-person collaboration. While remote work remains an option, Infosys is reinforcing the importance of face-to-face interactions for improved productivity, teamwork, and company culture.

With this updated policy, Infosys is setting clear expectations for its workforce, ensuring alignment between employee flexibility and business efficiency in a rapidly evolving work environment.

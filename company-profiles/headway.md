## Company blurb

### Vision

Bring entrepreneurial ideas to market & keep them there.

### Mission

To provide holistic services that elevate customers to their next phase of business and cover their blind spots by focusing on the people they serve and their ever-changing needs.

### About Headway

Founded in 2015, Headway was born out of a passion to bring entrepreneurial ideas to market and keep them there. We work holistically with our client partners as a true extension of their product team, not just as the technical execution arm of their business. If we see something broken, whether that’s a workflow, a marketing or messaging strategy, or a needless feature, we speak up, and our clients trust us to help them fix it.

Because we’re more than just designers and developers, we achieve results that bring successful long-term partnerships and trusted referrals. We help entrepreneurs build a business ―not just an app. This approach, coupled with realistic and incremental software releases, results in a friendly, fun, and collaborative atmosphere where our colleagues and clients both have room to learn and grow.

Or, if you’re a podcast fan, check out [Seaworthy](http://headway.io/seaworthy/), where we explore ways to help companies grow and scale their business and ideas.

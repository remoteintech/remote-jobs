## Company blurb

Bandcamp makes it easy for fans to directly connect with and support the artists they love. We treat music as art, not content, and we tie the success of our business to the success of the artists who we serve.

## Company size

[28](https://bandcamp.com/about)

## Remote status

We're now a team of 28, spread throughout libraries, cafes, co-working spaces and home offices all over the world, but united by a love of music and a desire to help those who make it.
There is no Bandcamp office. Our team is sprinkled throughout the world, with arms, cells, pods, what-have-yous in San Francisco, Montreal, The City of Angels, the Pacific NW, a Carolina, Pittsburgh, Vermont, the British Isles, Montreal, Berlin and I’m probably forgetting a few. We get together all day and night on slack, design and document everything in a wiki, do a short daily hangout that is exactly like the start of Hill Street Blues, and meet in person a few times a year for strategizing, working head-to-head, and laser bowling. If you do not have a strong social structure outside of work then employment at Bandcamp will likely lead to heart disease and an early death. We’re hiring!

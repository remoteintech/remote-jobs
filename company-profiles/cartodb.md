## Remote status

CartoDB can be described as "remote-friendly". From a current employee when [discussing in this repo](https://github.com/jessicard/remote-jobs/issues/153#issuecomment-155384024)
> While it's true that we don't explicitly announce the possibility to work remotely in our job openings, any employee can work wherever he or she wants.

>We currently have several people working 100% remote and also several other people work partially remote (i.e: they come to the Madrid office once every one or two weeks).

>It's true that we aren't a 100% remote company, but we are definitely remote-friendly.

20 and growing

## Remote status

All employees have a choice to work remotely or in the office, or a combination of both. The team meets in person at least once a year, paid for by the company, for an All Hands week in Santa Monica. Company meetings are always conducted over Zoom video, recorded for all to view later and documented with notes in a company-wide Google Team Drive.

We've written about what we've learned in [managing remote teams](https://blog.reactioncommerce.com/lessons-learned-managing-remote-teams/), our daily practice of [pair programming](https://blog.reactioncommerce.com/why-we-pair-program-every-day/), and published our [company manifesto](https://blog.reactioncommerce.com/our-team-manifesto/).

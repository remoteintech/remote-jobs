# Atomic Squirrel

## Company blurb

[Atomic Squirrel](http://www.atomic-squirrel.net/) specializes in helping startups get off the ground.

Launching a startup is a long, complicated, and confusing process. Most startups hire an experienced lawyer who they can call every time they have a legal question. Now you can hire an experienced startup team who you can call every time you have a product, technology, or team question. You can think of Atomic Squirrel as a "co-founder as a service."

We have helped many companies with product design, marketing strategy, data-driven development, system architecture, infrastructure development, coding practices, production deployment, scalability, research, recruiting, training, and much more. So no matter what your startup is struggling with, we can fill in the gaps.

## Company size

The core team is 2 people: 

* [Yevgeniy Brikman](http://www.ybrikman.com) is the founder of [Atomic Squirrel](http://www.atomic-squirrel.net/).

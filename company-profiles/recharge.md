# ReCharge Payments

## Company blurb

Our mission is to empower stores and store owners by making payments easy for everyone.

## Company size

Less than 50

## Remote status

The best people are everywhere, not just in the radius around our headquarters in Santa Monica, California. That’s why we have expanded our horizons all the way from the Andes in Argentina to the Rockies in Denver, Colorado. We've found that broadening our reach to build a remote team enables us to uncover outstanding talent.

The ReCharge team maintains a work-life balance approach. It’s not our goal to dash through the sprints, but rather to focus on building the future. We understand that hobbies exist and encourage our employees to pursue them. You’ll find out quickly that our team surfs, hikes, cycles, reads (hardcovers!), and festival hops - all while exceeding performance expectations at work.

Above all, we realize if you empower people to pursue their passions, they will help change the world.

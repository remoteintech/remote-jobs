## Company blurb

We offer innovation-as-a-service. Our entrepreneurial customers have raised over $1.4 billion in funding and enterprise customers have seen a 4x increase in valuations. 

We were featured as one of Deloitte's Fastest 50 Growing Tech Companies from India thrice (2016, 2018, and 2019). We were also featured in Deloitte Technology Fast 500 Asia Pacific both in 2016 and 2018. Our engineering studio has won O'Reilly's Architectural Katas event as well (Spring, 2022).

We solve complex design, build, and/or growth problems end-to-end for product introductions and expansions. We do design-thinking-led, agile, and scrum-led executions to quickly, iteratively solve build-from-scratch, re-engineering, project rescue, and prototyping challenges. 

We're outcome-driven, and will release prototypes in 4-6 weeks, MVPs in 4-6 months, and enable new capability launches quarterly (complete with design, build, and integrations).

# Joyent

## Company blurb

Since its inception, Joyent has lived on the leading edge of technical innovation. Joyent pioneered public cloud computing (and hybrid cloud), nurtured and grew Node.js into a de facto standard for web, mobile and IoT architectures, and was among the first to embrace and industrialize containers, compute-centric object storage, and what is now coming to be known as serverless computing.

## Company size

100 - 200 Employees

## Remote status

The majority of engineering is remote. Employees that live near office locations are welcome to work at the office.

## Region

We can hire people easily in United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Singapore, and South Korea, in part because we already have employees in those locales. Other locations are not impossible, but it’s much more difficult to make arrangements.
